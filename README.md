## Intro Machine Learning

### Essential Libraries and Tools
`$ pip3 install --upgrade pip`
`$ pip3 install -U numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn pandas pillow`
`$ pip3 install -U  jupyterlab`
- scikit-learn : 
  - https://scikit-learn.org/
  - built ontop of Numpy and SciPy
- Numpy
  - https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html
  - "a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more."
- SciPy
  - https://www.scipy.org/
  - "The SciPy ecosystem, a collection of open source software for scientific computing in Python." 
  - "a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics, and much more."
- Pandas
  - "When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame."
  - https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html
- matplotlib
  - https://matplotlib.org/
  - "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python."
- ipython
  - A powerful interactive shell. A kernel for Jupyter.
  - https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html
- jupyter
  - JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.
  - https://jupyter.org/install.html
- pillow
  - https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
  - Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors.
